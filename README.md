# C++ utilities for parsing and validation

## Overview

**ritsuko** provides common utilities for parsing and validation of file formats used throughout the [ArtifactDB](https://github.com/ArtifactDB) C++ codebase.
This is generally not intended for consumption by external developers, but they are nonetheless free to use it if they choose.
Functionality includes some convenience wrappers for HDF5 parsing, date/time string checking functions, a definition of R's missing value, 
and more random stuff that is re-usable across different C++ libraries.

## Further remarks

This library is named after [Ritsuko Akizuki](https://myanimelist.net/character/6170/Ritsuko_Akizuki), 
as befitting her important role in supporting the other idols in the series.
